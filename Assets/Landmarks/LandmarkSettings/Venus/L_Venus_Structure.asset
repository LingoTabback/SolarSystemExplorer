  m_Description: "If we could slice Venus and Earth in half, pole to pole, and place
    them side by side, they would look remarkably similar. Each planet has an iron
    core enveloped by a hot-rock mantle; the thinnest of skins forms a rocky, exterior
    crust. On both planets, this thin skin changes form and sometimes erupts into
    volcanoes in response to the ebb and flow of heat and pressure deep beneath.\r\n\r\nOther
    possible similarities will require further investigation \u2013 and perhaps another
    visit to a planet that has hosted many Earth probes, both in orbit and (briefly)
    on the surface. On Earth, the slow movement of continents over thousands and
    millions of years reshapes the surface, a process known as \u201Cplate tectonics.\u201D
    Something similar might have happened on Venus early in its history. Today a
    key element of this process could be operating: subduction, or the sliding of
    one continental \u201Cplate\u201D beneath another, which can also trigger volcanoes.
    Subduction is believed to be the first step in creating plate tectonics.\r\n\r\nNASA\u2019s
    Magellan spacecraft, which ended a five-year mission to Venus in 1994, mapped
    the broiling surface using radar. Magellan saw a land of extreme volcanism. The
    orbiter saw a relatively young surface, one recently reshaped (in geologic terms),
    and chains of towering mountains."
