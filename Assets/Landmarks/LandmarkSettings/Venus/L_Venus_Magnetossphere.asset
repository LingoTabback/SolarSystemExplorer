  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Even though Venus is similar in size to Earth and has a similar-sized
    iron core, the planet does not have its own internally generated magnetic field.
    Instead, Venus has what is known as an induced magnetic field. This weak magnetic
    field is created by the interaction of the Sun's magnetic field and the planet's
    outer atmosphere. Ultraviolet light from the Sun excites gases in Venus' outermost
    atmosphere; these electrically excited gases are called ions, and thus this region
    is called the ionosphere (Earth has an ionosphere as well). The solar wind \u2013
    a million-mile-per-hour gale of electrically charged particles streaming continuously
    from the Sun \u2013 carries with it the Sun's magnetic field. When the Sun's
    magnetic field interacts with the electrically excited ionosphere of Venus, it
    creates or induces, a magnetic field there. This induced magnetic field envelops
    the planet and is shaped like an extended teardrop, or the tail of a comet, as
    the solar wind blows past Venus and outward into the solar system."
