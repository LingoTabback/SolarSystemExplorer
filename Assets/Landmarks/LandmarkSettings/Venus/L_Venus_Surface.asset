  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The broiling surface of Venus has been a topic of heated discussion
    among planetary scientists. The traditional picture includes a catastrophic,
    planetwide resurfacing between 350 and 750 million years ago. In other words,
    Venus appears to have completely erased most traces of its early surface. The
    causes: volcanic and tectonic forces, which could include surface buckling and
    massive eruptions. But newer estimates made with help from computer models paint
    a different portrait. While the same forces would be at work, resurfacing would
    be piecemeal over an extended time. The average age of surface features could
    be as young as 150 million years, with some older surfaces mixed in.\n\nVenus
    is a landscape of valleys and high mountains dotted with thousands of volcanoes.
    Its surface features \u2013 most named for both real and mythical women \u2013
    include Ishtar Terra, a rocky, highland area around the size of Australia near
    the north pole, and an even larger, South-America-sized region called Aphrodite
    Terra that stretches across the equator. One mountain reaches 36,000 feet (11
    kilometers), higher than Mt. Everest. Notably, except for Earth, Venus has by
    far the fewest impact craters of any rocky planet, revealing a young surface.\r\n\r\nOn
    your tour of Venus, during the 117 days you\u2019re waiting for sunset, you might
    stop by a volcanic crater, Sacajawea, named for Lewis and Clark\u2019s Native
    American guide. Or stroll through a deep canyon, Diana, named for the Roman goddess
    of the hunt."
