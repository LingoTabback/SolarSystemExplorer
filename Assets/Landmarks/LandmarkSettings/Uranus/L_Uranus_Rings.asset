  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists
    mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are two outer rings: the innermost one
    is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring
    is blue like Saturn''s E ring.

    

    In order of increasing distance from
    the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta,
    Lambda, Epsilon, Nu, and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts
    of fine dust.'
