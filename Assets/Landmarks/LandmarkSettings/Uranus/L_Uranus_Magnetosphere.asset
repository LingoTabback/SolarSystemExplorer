  m_Title: Magnetosphere
  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere. Magnetic
    fields are typically in alignment with a planet's rotation, but Uranus' magnetic
    field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the
    planet's axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by
    one-third of the planet's radius.\r\n\r\nAuroras on Uranus are not in line with
    the poles (like they are on Earth, Jupiter, and Saturn) due to the lopsided magnetic
    field.\r\n\r\nThe magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into
    space for millions of miles. Its magnetic field lines are twisted by Uranus\u2019
    sideways rotation into a long corkscrew shape."
