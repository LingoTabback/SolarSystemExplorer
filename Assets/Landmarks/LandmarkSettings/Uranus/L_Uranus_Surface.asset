  m_Description: "As an ice giant, Uranus doesn\u2019t have a true surface. The planet
    is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus,
    it wouldn\u2019t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The
    extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft."
