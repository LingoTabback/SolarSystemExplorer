  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting
    other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus'' moons
    are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare
    and Alexander Pope.

    

    All of Uranus'' inner moons appear to be roughly
    half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons remains unknown,
    but they are likely captured asteroids.'
