  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Uranus is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the
    other is Neptune). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot
    dense fluid of \"icy\" materials \u2013 water, methane, and ammonia \u2013 above
    a small rocky core. Near the core, it heats up to 9,000 degrees Fahrenheit (4,982
    degrees Celsius).\r\n\r\nUranus is slightly larger in diameter than its neighbor
    Neptune, yet smaller in mass. It is the second least dense planet; Saturn is
    the least dense of all.\r\n\r\nUranus gets its blue-green color from methane
    gas in the atmosphere. Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and is reflected
    back out by Uranus' cloud tops. Methane gas absorbs the red portion of the light,
    resulting in a blue-green color."
