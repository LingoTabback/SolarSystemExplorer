  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Spacecraft images of Ganymede show its surface is a mix of two
    types of terrain. Forty percent of the surface is covered by highly cratered
    dark regions, and the remaining sixty percent is covered by a light grooved terrain,
    which forms intricate patterns across the moon. Some of the groove ridges are
    as high as 2,000 feet (700 meters), and the grooves run for thousands of miles
    across Ganymede''s surface. The large craters on Ganymede are mostly flat, probably
    due to settling in the soft icy surface. Both bright and dark rays of ejecta
    can be seen around Ganymede''s craters.

    

    In 2004, scientists discovered
    irregular lumps beneath the icy surface of Ganymede. The irregular masses may
    be rock formations, supported by Ganymede''s icy shell for billions of years.
    This tells scientists that the ice is probably strong enough, at least near the
    surface, to support such rock masses from sinking to the bottom of the ice. However,
    this anomaly could also be caused by piles of rock at the bottom of the ice.'
