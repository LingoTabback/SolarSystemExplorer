  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Ganymede has three main layers: A metallic iron core at its center,
    a spherical shell of rock (mantle) surrounding the core, and a spherical shell
    of mostly ice surrounding the rock shell. The surface is the very top of the
    ice shell. Scientists have discovered irregular lumps beneath Ganymede\u2019s
    icy surface. These irregular masses may be rock formations, supported by Ganymede's
    icy shell for billions of years.\r\n\r\nComputer models show Ganymede might have
    ice and oceans stacked up in several layers like a club sandwich. Scientists
    first suspected Ganymede had an underground ocean in the 1970s. The Galileo spacecraft
    discovered Ganymede's magnetic field in 1996, providing evidence to support the
    theory.\r\n\r\nNASA\u2019s Hubble Space Telescope has found more evidence for
    an underground saltwater ocean, and evidence of a thin oxygen atmosphere on Ganymede."
