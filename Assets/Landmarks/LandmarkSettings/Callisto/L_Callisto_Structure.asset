  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Callisto has an icy surface covered by craters of various shapes
    and sizes, including bowl-shaped craters and craters with multiple rings. Data
    gathered by the Galileo spacecraft indicate Callisto may have a subsurface ocean
    and scientists estimate it may be 155 miles (250 kilometers) below the surface.
    More recent research reveals that this ocean may be located deeper beneath the
    surface than previously thought, or may not exist at all. If there is an ocean,
    it may be interacting with rocks, giving Callisto a chance of supporting life.
    Callisto\u2019s interior may have layers of ice mixed with rock and metal, possibly
    extending to its center."
