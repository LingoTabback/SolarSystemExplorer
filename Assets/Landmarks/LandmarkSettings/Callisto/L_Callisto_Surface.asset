  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Callisto\u2019s rocky, icy surface is the oldest and most heavily
    cratered in our solar system. The surface is about 4 billion years old and it\u2019s
    been pummeled, likely by comets and asteroids. Because the impact craters are
    still visible, scientists think the moon has little geologic activity\u2014there
    are no active volcanoes or tectonic shifting to erode the craters. Callisto looks
    like it\u2019s sprinkled with bright white dots that scientists think are the
    peaks of the craters capped with water ice."
