  m_Description: The Viking 2 lander settled down at Utopia Planitia on September
    3 1976. esides taking photographs and collecting other science data on the Martian
    surface, the two landers conducted three biology experiments designed to look
    for possible signs of life. These experiments discovered unexpected and enigmatic
    chemical activity in the Martian soil, but provided no clear evidence for the
    presence of living microorganisms in soil near the landing sites. The last data
    from Viking Lander 2 arrived at Earth on April 11, 1980.
