  m_Description: "At around 1300 miles ( 2,200 kilometers ) in diameter, Hellas Planitia
    is the largest visible impact basin in the Solar System, and hosts the lowest
    elevations on Mars\u2019 surface as well as a variety of landscapes. This above
    image covers a small central portion of the basin and shows a dune field with
    lots of dust devil trails. In the middle, we see what appears to be long and
    straight \u201Cscratch marks\u201D running down the southeast (bottom-right)
    facing dune slopes. If we look closer, we can see these scratch marks actually
    squiggle back and forth on their way down the dune. These scratch marks are linear
    gullies."
