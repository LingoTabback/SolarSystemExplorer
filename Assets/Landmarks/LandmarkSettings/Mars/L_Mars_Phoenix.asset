  m_Caption: View from the Phoenix lander
  m_Description: Named for the resilient mythological bird, Phoenix used a lander
    that was intended for use by 2001's Mars Surveyor lander prior to its cancellation.
    It also carried a complex suite of instruments that were improved variations
    of those that flew on the lost Mars Polar Lander.In the continuing pursuit of
    water on Mars, the polar regions are a good place to probe, as water ice is found
    there. Phoenix landed on May 25th 2008, farther north than any previous mission,
    at a latitude equivalent to that of northern Alaska. During the course of its
    three-month mission, Phoenix dug into an ice-rich layer near the surface. It
    checked samples of soil and ice for evidence about whether the site was ever
    hospitable to life.To analyze soil samples collected by its robotic arm, Phoenix
    carried tiny ovens and a portable laboratory. Selected samples were heated to
    release volatiles that were examined for their chemical composition and other
    characteristics. Phoenix's mission ended on November 2nd 2008.
