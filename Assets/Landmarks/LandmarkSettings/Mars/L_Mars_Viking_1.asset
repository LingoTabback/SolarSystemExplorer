  m_Description: The Viking 1 lander touched down on the western slope of Chryse
    Planitia (the Plains of Gold) on July 20th 1976. Besides taking photographs and
    collecting other science data on the Martian surface, the two viking landers
    conducted three biology experiments designed to look for possible signs of life.
    These experiments discovered unexpected and enigmatic chemical activity in the
    Martian soil, but provided no clear evidence for the presence of living microorganisms
    in soil near the landing sites. Viking Lander 1 made its final transmission to
    Earth November 11, 1982
