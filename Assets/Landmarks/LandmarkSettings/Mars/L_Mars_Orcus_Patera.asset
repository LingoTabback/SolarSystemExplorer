  m_Description: Orcus Patera is an irregular, large elliptical feature with limited
    evidence of an ejecta blanket or U-shaped basin that would favor an origin as
    an impact crater. The strongest arguments suggestive of impact origins are in
    cavity wall and flank slopes. The odd shape, age relations and flat-floor topography
    fit better into a model for a volcanic caldera. We conclude that the current
    evidence favors a volcanic origin for Orcus Patera. The above image is of a small
    field of sand dunes at the bottom of a small crater within Orcus Patera.
