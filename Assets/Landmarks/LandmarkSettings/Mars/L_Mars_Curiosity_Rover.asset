  m_Description: Curiosity is the largest and most capable rover ever sent to Mars.
    It launched November 26, 2011 and landed on Mars at 10:32 p.m. PDT on Aug. 5,
    2012 (1:32 a.m. EDT on Aug. 6, 2012). Mars Science Laboratory arrived at Mars
    through technological innovations that tested a completely new landing method.
    The spacecraft descended on a parachute, then during the final seconds before
    landing, the landing system fired rockets to allow it to hover while a tether
    lowered Curiosity to the surface. The rover landed on its wheels, the tether
    was cut, and the landing system flew off to crash-land a safe distance away.
    Curiosity carries the biggest, most advanced instruments for scientific studies
    ever sent to the Martian surface. The history of Martian climate and geology
    is written in the chemistry and structure of the rocks and soil. Curiosity reads
    this record by analyzing powdered samples drilled from rocks. It also measures
    the chemical fingerprints present in different rocks and soils to determine their
    composition and history, especially their past interactions with water.
