  m_Description: Spirit landed at Gusev Crater, a possible former lake in a giant
    impact crater on January 4 2004. While Spirit's initial travels in Gusev Crater
    revealed a more basaltic setting, after reaching the 'Columbia Hills' the rover
    found a variety of rocks indicating that early Mars was characterized by impacts,
    explosive volcanism, and subsurface water. Unusual-looking bright patches of
    soil turned out to be extremely salty and affected by past water. At 'Home Plate',
    a circular feature in the 'Inner Basin' of the 'Columbia Hills', Spirit discovered
    finely layered rocks that are as geologically compelling as those found by Opportunity.
    Spirit's mission ended on March 22nd 2010.
