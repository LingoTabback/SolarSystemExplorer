  m_Description: 'Mars has two small moons, Phobos and Deimos, that may be captured
    asteroids. They''re potato-shaped because they have too little mass for gravity
    to make them spherical.


    The moons get their names from the horses that
    pulled the chariot of the Greek god of war, Ares.


    Phobos, the innermost
    and larger moon, is heavily cratered, with deep grooves on its surface. It is
    slowly moving towards Mars and will crash into the planet or break apart in about
    50 million years.


    Deimos is about half as big as Phobos and orbits two
    and a half times farther away from Mars. Oddly-shaped Deimos is covered in loose
    dirt that often fills the craters on its surface, making it appear smoother than
    pockmarked Phobos.'
