  m_Description: Valles Marineris, or Mariner Valley, is a vast canyon system that
    runs along the Martian equator just east of the Tharsis region. Valles Marineris
    is 2500 mi (4000 km) long and reaches depths of up to 4 miles (7km) For comparison,
    the Grand Canyon in Arizona is only 500 miles (800km) long and 1 mile (1.6km)
    deep. In fact, the extent of Valles Marineris is as long as the United States
    and it spans about 20 percent (1/5) of the entire distance around Mars! The canyon
    extends from the Noctis Labyrinthus region in the west to the chaotic terrain
    in the east. Most researchers agree that Valles Marineris is a large tectonic
    'crack' in the Martian crust, forming as the planet cooled, affected by the rising
    crust in the Tharsis region to the west, and subsequently widened by erosional
    forces. However, near the eastern flanks of the rift there appear to be some
    channels that may have been formed by water.
