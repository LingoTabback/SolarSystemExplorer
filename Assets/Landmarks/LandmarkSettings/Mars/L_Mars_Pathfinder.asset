  m_Description: Mars Pathfinder was launched December 4, 1996 and landed on Mars'
    Ares Vallis on July 4, 1997. It was designed as a technology demonstration of
    a new way to deliver an instrumented lander and the first-ever robotic rover
    to the surface of the red planet. Pathfinder not only accomplished this goal
    but also returned an unprecedented amount of data and outlived its primary design
    life.Both the lander and the 23-pound (10.6 kilogram) rover carried instruments
    for scientific observations and to provide engineering data on the new technologies
    being demonstrated. Included were scientific instruments to analyze the Martian
    atmosphere, climate, geology and the composition of its rocks and soil. Mars
    Pathfinder used an innovative method of directly entering the Martian atmosphere,
    assisted by a parachute to slow its descent through the thin Martian atmosphere
    and a giant system of airbags to cushion the impact.
