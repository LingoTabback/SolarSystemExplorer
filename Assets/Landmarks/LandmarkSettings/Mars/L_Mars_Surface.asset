  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface, we see
    colors such as brown, gold, and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to
    oxidization \u2013 or rusting \u2013 of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian
    \u201Csoil\u201D), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere
    and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.\r\n\r\nInterestingly,
    while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same
    area as Earth\u2019s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement,
    and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of
    Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system's most interesting topographical
    features.\r\n\r\nA large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough
    to stretch from California to New York \u2013 more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers).
    This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles
    (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That's about 10 times the size of Earth's Grand
    Canyon.\n\nMars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons.
    It's three times taller than Earth's Mt. Everest with a base the size of the
    state of New Mexico.\r\n\r\nMars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient
    river valley networks, deltas, and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on
    the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest
    that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago.\r\n\r\nThere is
    water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water
    to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of
    water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty)
    water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls."
