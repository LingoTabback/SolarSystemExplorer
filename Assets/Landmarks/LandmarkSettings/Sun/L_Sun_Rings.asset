  m_Caption: "In this illustration, several dust rings circle the Sun. These rings
    form when planets\u2019 gravities tug dust grains into orbit around the Sun.
    Recently, scientists have detected a dust ring at Mercury\u2019s orbit. Others
    hypothesize the source of Venus\u2019 dust ring is a group of never-before-detected
    co-orbital asteroids.\nCredits: NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center/Mary

  m_Description: The Sun would have been surrounded by a disk of gas and dust early
    in its history when the solar system was first forming, about 4.6 billion years
    ago. Some of that dust is still around today, in several dust rings that circle
    the Sun. They trace the orbits of planets, whose gravity tugs dust into place
    around the Sun.
