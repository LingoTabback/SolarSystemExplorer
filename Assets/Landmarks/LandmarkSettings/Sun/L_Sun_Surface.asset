  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The Sun doesn\u2019t have a solid surface like Earth and the other
    rocky planets and moons. The part of the Sun commonly called its surface is the
    photosphere. The word photosphere means \"light sphere\" \u2013 which is apt
    because this is the layer that emits the most visible light. It\u2019s what we
    see from Earth with our eyes. (Hopefully, it goes without saying \u2013 but never
    look directly at the Sun without protecting your eyes.)\r\n\r\nAlthough we call
    it the surface, the photosphere is actually the first layer of the solar atmosphere.
    It's about 250 miles thick, with temperatures reaching about 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit
    (5,500 degrees Celsius). That's much cooler than the blazing core, but it's still
    hot enough to make carbon \u2013 like diamonds and graphite \u2013 not just melt,
    but boil. Most of the Sun's radiation escapes outward from the photosphere into
    space."
