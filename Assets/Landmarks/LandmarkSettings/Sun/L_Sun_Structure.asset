  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The Sun is a huge ball of hydrogen and helium held together by
    its own gravity.\r\n\r\nThe Sun has several regions. The interior regions include
    the core, the radiative zone, and the convection zone. Moving outward \u2013
    the visible surface or photosphere is next, then the chromosphere, followed by
    the transition zone, and then the corona \u2013 the Sun\u2019s expansive outer
    atmosphere.\r\n\r\nOnce material leaves the corona at supersonic speeds, it becomes
    the solar wind, which forms a huge magnetic \"bubble\" around the Sun, called
    the heliosphere. The heliosphere extends beyond the orbit of the planets in our
    solar system. Thus, Earth exists inside the Sun\u2019s atmosphere. Outside the
    heliosphere is interstellar space.\r\n\r\nThe core is the hottest part of the
    Sun. Nuclear reactions here \u2013 where hydrogen is fused to form helium \u2013
    power the Sun\u2019s heat and light. Temperatures top 27 million \xB0F (15 million
    \xB0C) and it\u2019s about 86,000 miles (138,000 kilometers) thick. The density
    of the Sun\u2019s core is about 150 grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm\xB3). That
    is approximately 8 times the density of gold (19.3 g/cm\xB3) or 13 times the
    density of lead (11.3 g/cm\xB3).\r\n\r\nEnergy from the core is carried outward
    by radiation. This radiation bounces around the radiative zone, taking about
    170,000 years to get from the core to the top of the convection zone. Moving
    outward, in the convection zone, the temperature drops below 3.5 million \xB0F
    (2 million \xB0C). Here, large bubbles of hot plasma (a soup of ionized atoms)
    move upward toward the photosphere, which is the layer we think of as the Sun's
    surface."
