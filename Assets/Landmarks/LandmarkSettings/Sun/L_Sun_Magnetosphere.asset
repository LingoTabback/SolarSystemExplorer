  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The Sun generates magnetic fields that extend out into space to
    form the interplanetary magnetic field \u2013 the magnetic field that pervades
    our solar system. The field is carried through the solar system by the solar
    wind \u2013 a stream of electrically charged gas blowing outward from the Sun
    in all directions. The vast bubble of space dominated by the Sun\u2019s magnetic
    field is called the heliosphere. Since the Sun rotates, the magnetic field spins
    out into a large rotating spiral, known as the Parker spiral. This spiral has
    a shape something like the pattern of water from a rotating garden sprinkler.\r\n\r\nThe
    Sun doesn't behave the same way all the time. It goes through phases of high
    and low activity, which make up the solar cycle. Approximately every 11 years,
    the Sun\u2019s geographic poles change their magnetic polarity \u2013 that is,
    the north and south magnetic poles swap. During this cycle, the Sun's photosphere,
    chromosphere, and corona change from quiet and calm to violently active.\r\n\r\nThe
    height of the Sun\u2019s activity cycle, known as solar maximum, is a time of
    greatly increased solar storm activity. Sunspots, eruptions called solar flares,
    and coronal mass ejections are common at solar maximum. The latest solar cycle
    \u2013 Solar Cycle 25 \u2013 started in December 2019 when solar minimum occurred,
    according to the Solar Cycle 25 Prediction Panel, an international group of experts
    co-sponsored by NASA and NOAA. Scientists now expect the Sun\u2019s activity
    to ramp up toward the next predicted maximum in July 2025.\r\n\r\nSolar activity
    can release huge amounts of energy and particles, some of which impact us here
    on Earth. Much like weather on Earth, conditions in space \u2013 known as space
    weather \u2013 are always changing with the Sun\u2019s activity. \"Space weather\"
    can interfere with satellites, GPS, and radio communications. It also can cripple
    power grids, and corrode pipelines that carry oil and gas.\r\n\r\nThe strongest
    geomagnetic storm on record is the Carrington Event, named for British astronomer
    Richard Carrington who observed the Sept. 1, 1859, solar flare that triggered
    the event. Telegraph systems worldwide went haywire. Spark discharges shocked
    telegraph operators and set their telegraph paper on fire. Just before dawn the
    next day, skies all over Earth erupted in red, green, and purple auroras \u2013
    the result of energy and particles from the Sun interacting with Earth\u2019s
    atmosphere. Reportedly, the auroras were so brilliant that newspapers could be
    read as easily as in daylight. The auroras, or Northern Lights, were visible
    as far south as Cuba, the Bahamas, Jamaica, El Salvador, and Hawaii."
