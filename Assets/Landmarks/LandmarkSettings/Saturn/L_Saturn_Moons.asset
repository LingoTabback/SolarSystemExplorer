  m_Description: Saturn is home to a vast array of intriguing and unique worlds.
    From the haze-shrouded surface of Titan to crater-riddled Phoebe, each of Saturn's
    moons tells another piece of the story surrounding the Saturn system. Saturn
    has 83 moons. Sixty-three moons are confirmed and named, and another 20 moons
    are awaiting confirmation of discovery and official naming by the International
