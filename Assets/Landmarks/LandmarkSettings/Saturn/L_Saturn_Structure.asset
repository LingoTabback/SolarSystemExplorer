  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Like Jupiter, Saturn is made mostly of hydrogen and helium. At
    Saturn's center is a dense core of metals like iron and nickel surrounded by
    rocky material and other compounds solidified by intense pressure and heat. It
    is enveloped by liquid metallic hydrogen inside a layer of liquid hydrogen \u2013similar
    to Jupiter's core but considerably smaller.\n\nIt's hard to imagine, but Saturn
    is the only planet in our solar system with an average density that is less than
    water. The giant gas planet could float in a bathtub if such a colossal thing
    existed."
