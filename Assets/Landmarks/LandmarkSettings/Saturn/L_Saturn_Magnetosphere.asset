  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Saturn''s magnetic field is smaller than Jupiter''s but still 578
    times as powerful as Earth''s. Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites
    lie totally within Saturn''s enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which
    the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn''s
    magnetic field than by the solar wind.


    Aurorae occur when charged particles
    spiral into a planet''s atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth, these
    charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at least some
    of Saturn''s aurorae are like Jupiter''s and are largely unaffected by the solar
    wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a combination of particles ejected
    from Saturn''s moons and Saturn''s magnetic field''s rapid rotation rate. But
    these "non-solar-originating" aurorae are not completely understood yet.'
