  m_Description: "As a gas giant, Saturn doesn\u2019t have a true surface. The planet
    is mostly swirling gases and liquids deeper down. While a spacecraft would have
    nowhere to land on Saturn, it wouldn\u2019t be able to fly through unscathed
    either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet would crush,
    melt, and vaporize any spacecraft trying to fly into the planet."
