  m_Description: 'Saturn''s rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids,
    or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by
    Saturn''s powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small chunks of ice
    and rock coated with other materials such as dust. The ring particles mostly
    range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles
    are as large as mountains. The rings would look mostly white if you looked at
    them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a
    different speed around the planet.


    Saturn''s ring system extends up to
    175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is
    typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in
    the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other,
    with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) in width
    called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are
    A, B, and C. Rings D, E, F, and G are fainter and more recently discovered.


    Starting
    at Saturn and moving outward, there is the D ring, C ring, B ring, Cassini Division,
    A ring, F ring, G ring, and finally, the E ring. Much farther out, there is the
    very faint Phoebe ring in the orbit of Saturn''s moon Phoebe.'
