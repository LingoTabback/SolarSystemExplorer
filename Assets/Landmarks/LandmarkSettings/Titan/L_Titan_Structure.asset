  m_Description: "Titan\u2019s internal structure isn\u2019t entirely known, but
    one model based on data from the Cassini-Huygens mission suggests Titan has five
    primary layers. The innermost layer is a core of rock (specifically, water-bearing
    silicate rock) about 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) in diameter. Surrounding
    the core is a shell of water ice\u2014a special type called ice-VI that is only
    found at extremely high-pressures. The high-pressure ice is surrounded by a layer
    of salty liquid water, on top of which sits an outer crust of water ice. This
    surface is coated with organic molecules that have rained or otherwise settled
    out of the atmosphere in the form of sands and liquids. The surface is hugged
    by a dense atmosphere."
