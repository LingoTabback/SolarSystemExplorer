  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The surface of Titan is one of the most Earthlike places in the
    solar system, albeit at vastly colder temperatures and with different chemistry.
    Here it is so cold (-290 degrees Fahrenheit or -179 degrees Celsius) that water
    ice plays the role of rock. Titan may have volcanic activity as well, but with
    liquid water \u201Clava\u201D instead of molten rock. Titan\u2019s surface is
    sculpted by flowing methane and ethane, which carves river channels and fills
    great lakes with liquid natural gas. No other world in the solar system, aside
    from Earth, has that kind of liquid activity on its surface.\n\nVast regions
    of dark dunes stretch across Titan\u2019s landscape, primarily around the equatorial
    regions. The \"sand\" in these dunes is composed of dark hydrocarbon grains thought
    to look something like coffee grounds. In appearance, the tall, linear dunes
    are not unlike those seen in the desert of Namibia in Africa. Titan has few visible
    impact craters, meaning its surface must be relatively young and some combination
    of processes erases evidence of impacts over time. Earth is similar in that respect
    as well; craters on our planet are erased by the relentless forces of flowing
    liquid (water, in Earth's case), wind, and the recycling of the crust via plate
    tectonics. These forces are present on Titan as well, in modified forms. In particular,
    tectonic forces\u2014the movement of the ground due to pressures from beneath\u2014appear
    to be at work on the icy moon, although scientists do not see evidence of plates
    like on Earth."
