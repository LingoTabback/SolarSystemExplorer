  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Mercury's surface resembles that of Earth's Moon, scarred by many
    impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters
    and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians, or
    authors, including children's author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.\n\nVery
    large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter)
    and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by
    asteroid impacts on the planet's surface early in the solar system's history.
    While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds
    of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet's interior
    cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.\n\nMost
    of Mercury's surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright
    streaks are called \"crater rays.\" They are formed when an asteroid or comet
    strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such
    an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock
    under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the
    crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed
    rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space
    environment \u2013 dust impacts and solar-wind particles \u2013 causes the rays
    to darken with time.\n\nTemperatures on Mercury are extreme. During the day,
    temperatures on the surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius).
    Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures
    on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).\n\nMercury
    may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only
    in regions in permanent shadows. In those shadows, it could be cold enough to
    preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet."
