  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large
    metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85
    percent of the planet's radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten or
    liquid. Mercury's outer shell, comparable to Earth's outer shell (called the
    mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.
