  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator.
    Though Mercury's magnetic field at the surface has just 1% the strength of Earth's,
    it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense
    magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface
    of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged
    atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.\r"
