  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind
    of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 80 moons. Fifty-seven moons have been
    given official names by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). Another 23
    moons are awaiting names.\r\n\r\nJupiter's four largest moons \u2013 Io, Europa,
    Ganymede, and Callisto \u2013 were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei
    in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today
    as the Galilean satellites, and they're some of the most fascinating destinations
    in our solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system.
    Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet
    Mercury). Callisto\u2019s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current
    surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie
    beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore."
