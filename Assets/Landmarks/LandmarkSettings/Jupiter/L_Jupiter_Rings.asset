  m_Caption: New Horizons spacecraft image of Jupiter's faint dust rings
  m_Description: Discovered in 1979 by NASA's Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter's rings
    were a surprise, as they are composed of small, dark particles and are difficult
    to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate
    that Jupiter's ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary
    meteoroids smash into the giant planet's small innermost moons.
