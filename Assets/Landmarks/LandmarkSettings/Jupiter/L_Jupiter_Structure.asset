  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun \u2013
    mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature
    increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the
    largest ocean in the solar system \u2013 an ocean made of hydrogen instead of
    water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet's center,
    the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms,
    making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter's fast rotation
    is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet's
    powerful magnetic field. It is still unclear if deeper down, Jupiter has a central
    core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup. It
    could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down there,
    made mostly of iron and silicate minerals (similar to quartz)."
