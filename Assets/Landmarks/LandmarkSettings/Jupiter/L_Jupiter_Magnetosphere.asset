  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter''s
    powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million
    kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter of Jupiter itself)
    and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1
    billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn''s orbit. Jupiter''s enormous
    magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates
    with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge. Near the
    planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates
    them to very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost
    moons and can damage spacecraft.

    

    Jupiter''s magnetic field also
    causes some of the solar system''s most spectacular aurorae at the planet''s
    poles.'
