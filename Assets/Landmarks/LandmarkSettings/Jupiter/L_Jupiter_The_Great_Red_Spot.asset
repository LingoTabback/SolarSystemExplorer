  m_Title: The Great Red Spot
  m_Caption: A Swirling Mystery
  m_Description: "The largest and most powerful hurricanes ever recorded on Earth
    spanned over 1,000 miles across with winds gusting up to around 200 mph. That\u2019s
    wide enough to stretch across nearly all U.S. states east of Texas. But even
    that kind of storm is dwarfed by the Great Red Spot, a gigantic storm in Jupiter.
    There, gigantic means twice as wide as Earth. With tumultuous winds peaking at
    about 400 mph, the Great Red Spot has been swirling wildly over Jupiter\u2019s
    skies for the past 150 years\u2014maybe even much longer than that."
