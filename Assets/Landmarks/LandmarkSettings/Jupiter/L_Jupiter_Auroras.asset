  m_Title: Auroras
  m_Caption: Perpetual Light Show
  m_Description: Jupiter is best known for its colorful storms. But also has some
    of the most vivid auroras. Not only are the auroras bigger than Earth, they are
    also hundreds of times more energetic than auroras on our home world. And, unlike
    those on Earth, they never cease. On Earth the most intense auroras are caused
    by solar storms, but Jupiter generates its own. The strong magnetic field of
    the gas giant grabs charged particles from its surroundings, including particles
    thrown into space by its orbiting moon Io, known for its numerous and large volcanoes.
