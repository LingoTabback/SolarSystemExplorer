  m_Description: "The central caldera (above and just left of center) of Io\u2019s
    Culann region has an irregular, scalloped margin and a green-colored floor. Lava
    spills out of the caldera on all sides. Green material can also be seen in the
    caldera to the lower right of the image, named Tohil Patera. The Galileo spacecraft
    captured the images used to create this mosaic from about 12,500 miles (20,000
    kilometers) from Io on Nov. 25, 1999."
