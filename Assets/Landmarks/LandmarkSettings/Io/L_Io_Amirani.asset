  m_Description: "This mosaic of Io\u2019s Amirani region combines black and white
    and color images captured in 1999 and 2000 by the Galileo spacecraft. Fresh lava
    is leaking from at least five areas at the northern end of the Amirani flow field
    and at least three places in the middle. The main Amirani plume appears to emanate
    from a fuzzy, purplish area in the southern part of the flow field. The mosaic
    shows an area 310 miles (500 kilometers) long and 110 miles (180 kilometers)
    wide."
