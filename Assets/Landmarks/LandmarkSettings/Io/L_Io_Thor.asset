  m_Title: Thor
  m_Caption: 'Named after the Norse god of thunder, the Thor volcano produced the
    two largest volcanic plumes ever detected on Io. Image Credit: NASA/JPL.'
  m_Description: Galileo's near-infrared mapping spectrometer captured the image
    on the left during an Oct. 16, 2001 flyby of Io. Coloring indicates the intensity
    of glowing at a wavelength of 4.1 microns. Yellow, red, and white represent high
    temperatures. Black is where the near-infrared glow was so intense the image
    was saturated. Greens and blues are cold. The visible-light image on the right
    was obtained by Galileo's camera in 1999, before any volcanic activity was seen
    at this site. The first sign of activity came in August 2001, when Galileo detected
    an infrared hot spot and the tallest volcanic plume ever seen at Io.
