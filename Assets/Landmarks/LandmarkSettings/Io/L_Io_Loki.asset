  m_Description: "Voyager 1 captured this image of Io\u2019s volcano Loki as the
    spacecraft passed through the Jovian system in 1979. When the picture was taken,
    the main eruptive activity came from the lower left of the dark linear feature
    (perhaps a rift) in the center. The U-shaped dark area to the left is probably
    a \u201Clava lake\u201D and is about 200 kilometers across. The apparent bergs
    may be solid sulfur in a liquid sulfur lake. Voyager 1 found this 'lava lake'
    to be the hottest region on Io."
