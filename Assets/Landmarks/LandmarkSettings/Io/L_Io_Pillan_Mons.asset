  m_Title: Pillan Mons
  m_Caption: 'The volcano and mountain named Pillan Mons is responsible for the region
    of black material that blemished part of the reddish ring around the volcano
    named Pele. The name Pillan comes from the Araucanian god of thunder, fire, and
    volcanoes. Image Credit: NASA/JPL/University of Arizona.'
  m_Description: "Taken by the Galileo spacecraft on Oct. 11, 1999, this observation
    targeted a 44-mile (70-kilometer) lava flow that erupted two years earlier from
    Pillan Patera (the dark caldera near the top). This was on Galileo\u2019s 24th
    orbit of Jupiter, and intense radiation pummeled the spacecraft each time it
    passed close to the planet. The radiation caused Galileo's camera to scramble
    the images used to create this mosaic. NASA engineers unscrambled much of the
    data, but were unable to recover the data for some areas, which appear as black
    stripes in the image."
