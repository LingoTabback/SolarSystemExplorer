  m_Description: "The Galileo spacecraft captured this image of Tupan Patera in October
    2001. About 47 miles (75 kilometers) across, the Tupan volcanic depression is
    surrounded by cliffs about 3,000 feet (900 meters) tall. The color in the image
    is only slightly enhanced from what a human eye would see (the reds includes
    a small amount of infrared that humans can\u2019t detect)."
