  m_Title: Magnetosphere
  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: As Jupiter rotates, it takes its magnetic field around with it,
    sweeping past Io and stripping off about 1 ton (1,000 kilograms) of Io's material
    every second. This material becomes ionized in the magnetic field and forms a
    doughnut-shaped cloud of intense radiation referred to as a plasma torus. Some
    of the ions are pulled into Jupiter's atmosphere along the magnetic lines of
    force and create auroras in the planet's upper atmosphere. It is the ions escaping
    from this torus that inflate Jupiter's magnetosphere to over twice the size we
    would expect.
