    is named after the Mayan thunder and rain god. Image Credit: NASA/JPL/University
    of Arizona."
  m_Description: This view of a Chaac region caldera was produced from images taken
    by the Galileo spacecraft on Feb. 22, 2000. Galileo captured the five partial
    images on the right from between 400 and 500 miles (700 to 800 kilometers) from
    Io. They are the highest-resolution images ever of lava flows on Io. The approximate
    locations of the five partial images are represented as boxes in the lower-resolution
    image to the left. For scale, the deep, dark pit in the southernmost partial
    image is thought to be about 440 yards (400 meters) across.
