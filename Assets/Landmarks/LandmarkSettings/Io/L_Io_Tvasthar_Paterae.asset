  m_Description: "Seen here is part Tvashtar Paterea, a chain of giant volcanic calderas.
    The two small bright spots at the far left, just above center, are molten rock
    exposed to the surface at the toes of lava flows. The larger orange and yellow
    ribbon is a cooling lava flow more than 37 miles (60 kilometers) long. On Feb.
    22, 2000, the Galileo spacecraft captured images in the near-infrared, clear,
    and violet filters \u2014 in all, slightly more than the human eye can detect
    \u2014 which were combined to produce this mosaic. The image is about 155 miles
    (250 kilometers) across."
