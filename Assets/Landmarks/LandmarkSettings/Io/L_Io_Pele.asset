  m_Title: Pele
  m_Caption: 'Two images from the Voyager mission captured Pele erupting, confirming
    the existence of active volcanism on Io. It was the first time active volcanoes
    were found on a world other than Earth. Pele is named after the Hawaiian volcano
    goddess. Image Credit: NASA/JPL/Ames Research Center.'
  m_Description: "The large orange ring dominating the leftmost third of this image
    is a deposit from the plume of Io\u2019s Pele volcano. The material ejected from
    the volcano collects on the surface more than 350 miles (about 600 kilometers)
    from the dark central vent. The Galileo spacecraft took the images used to create
    this view on the spacecraft\u2019s first and third orbit of Jupiter in June and
    November of 1996."
