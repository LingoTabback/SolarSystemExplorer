  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: The tidal forces generate a tremendous amount of heat within Io,
    keeping much of its subsurface crust in liquid form seeking any available escape
    route to the surface to relieve the pressure. Thus, the surface of Io is constantly
    renewing itself, filling in any impact craters with molten lava lakes and spreading
    smooth new floodplains of liquid rock. The composition of this material is not
    yet entirely clear, but theories suggest that it is largely molten sulfur and
    its compounds (which would account for the varied coloring) or silicate rock
    (which would better account for the apparent temperatures, which may be too hot
    to be sulfur). Sulfur dioxide is the primary constituent of a thin atmosphere
    on Io. It has no water to speak of, unlike the other, colder Galilean moons.
    Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicates that an iron core may form Io's center,
    thus giving Io its own magnetic field.
