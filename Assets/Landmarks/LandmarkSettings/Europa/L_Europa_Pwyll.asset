  m_Caption: "\u200BThis enhanced color image of the region surrounding Pwyll crater
    was taken by NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft in December 1996."
  m_Description: Pwyll, featured in this image, is thought to be one of the youngest
    features on Europa's surface. The diameter of the central dark spot is approximately
    25 miles (about 40 kilometers), and bright white rays extend for hundreds of
    miles in all directions from the impact site. The rays cross over many different
    terrain types, indicating that they are younger than anything they cross. Their
    bright white color may indicate that they are composed of fresh, fine water-ice
    particles, as opposed to the blue and brown tints of older materials elsewhere
    in the image.
