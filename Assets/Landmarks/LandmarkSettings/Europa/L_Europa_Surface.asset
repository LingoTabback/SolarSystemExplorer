  m_Caption: 'The image on the left shows a region of Europa''s crust made up of
    blocks which are thought to have broken apart and "rafted" into new positions.
    These images were obtained by NASA''s Galileo spacecraft in 1996 and 1997 at
    a distance of 417,489 miles (677,000 kilometers). Credit: NASA/JPL/University

  m_Description: "Europa\u2019s water-ice surface is crisscrossed by dark, reddish-brown
    cracks. Based on the small number of observable craters, the surface of this
    moon appears to be no more than 40 to 90 million years old, which is youthful
    in geologic terms (the surface of Callisto, another of Jupiter\u2019s moons,
    is estimated to be a few billion years old). All along Europa's many fractures,
    and in splotchy patterns across its surface, is a reddish-brown material whose
    composition is not known for certain, but likely contains salts and sulfur compounds
    that have been mixed with the water ice and modified by radiation. This surface
    composition may hold clues to the moon's potential as a habitable world.\n\nNASA's
    Galileo spacecraft explored the Jupiter system from 1995 to 2003 and made numerous
    flybys of Europa. Galileo revealed strange pits and domes that suggest Europa\u2019s
    ice layer could be slowly churning, or convecting (cooler, denser ice sinks,
    while warmer less-dense ice rises) due to heat from below. Long, linear fractures
    are often only about a half mile to a mile wide (1-2 kilometers wide) but can
    extend for thousands of kilometers across Europa\u2019s surface. Some of these
    fractures have built up into ridges hundreds of meters tall, while others appear
    to have pulled apart into wide bands of multiple parallel fractures.\r\n\r\nGalileo
    also found regions called \"chaos terrain,\" where broken, blocky landscapes
    were covered in mysterious reddish material. In 2011, scientists studying Galileo
    data proposed that chaos terrains could be places where the surface collapsed
    above lens-shaped lakes embedded within the ice."
