  m_Title: Agenor Linea
  m_Caption: "These combined Galileo spacecraft images taken in September 1998 show
    Agenor Linea is not a ridge, but is relatively flat.\u200B"
  m_Description: Agenor Linea is an unusual feature on Europa, since it is brighter
    than its surroundings while most of Europa's ridges and bands are relatively
    dark. Its interior consists of several long bands, just one of which is the very
    bright feature known as Agenor. A few very small craters pockmark Agenor Linea
    and its surroundings. Agenor is cut by narrow fractures, and by small rounded
    features called lenticulae.
