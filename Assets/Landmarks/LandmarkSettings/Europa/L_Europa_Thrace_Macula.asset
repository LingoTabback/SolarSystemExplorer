  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: Thrace Macula is the largest dark spot on the surface of Europa.
    Its chaotic terrain has been recently modified and resurfaced. Thrace is long,
    shows a hummocky (irregular) surface texture, and appears to stand at or slightly
    above the older surrounding bright plains. Vertical relief (the difference in
    elevation between the highest and lowest points) is approximately 1,150 feet
    (350 meters).
