  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Like our planet, Europa is thought to have an iron core, a rocky
    mantle, and an ocean of salty water. Unlike Earth, however, Europa\u2019s ocean
    lies below a shell of ice probably 10 to 15 miles (15 to 25 kilometers) thick,
    and has an estimated depth of 40 to 100 miles (60 to 150 kilometers). While evidence
    for an internal ocean is strong, its presence awaits confirmation by a future
    mission."
