  m_Title: Tyre
  m_Caption: "\u200BTyre is an unusually large impact structure on Europa. Images
    taken by NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft in April 1997 were used to create this
    enhanced-color view."
  m_Description: "Europa\u2019s Tyre impact structure likely formed when a mountain-sized
    asteroid slammed into the moon. The crater-like area is about 25 miles (40 kilometers)
    across, but the entire structure, including its concentric rings, is about the
    size of the island of Hawaii on Earth (86 miles, or 140 kilometers across). Some
    of the smaller craters that pockmark the surface surrounding Tyre were formed
    when material was ejected by the impact and then fell back to the surface."
