  m_Title: Conamara Chaos
  m_Caption: "\u200BThis mosaic of the Conamara Chaos region was created from data
    sent back by NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft after its sixth Europa flyby in February
    1997."
  m_Description: "This mosaic of the Conamara Chaos region clearly indicates relatively
    recent modification of Europa's surface. The ice rafts look a lot like what scientists
    see on Earth\u2019s poles, where large chunks of ice break away and move to new
    positions. The blocks on Europa were shifted, rotated, and even tipped and partially
    submerged within a mobile material that was either liquid water, warm mobile
    ice, or an ice and water slush. The presence of young fractures cutting through
    Conamara Chaos indicate that the surface froze again into solid, brittle ice.
    Scientists believe this region may contain clues about the composition of Europa\u2019s
    ocean."
