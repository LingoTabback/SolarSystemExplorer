  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: Thera Macula is a dark, reddish chaotic region of irregular terrain
    that disrupts the older icy ridged plains on Europa. Thera is about 43 miles
    wide by 53 miles long (70 kilometers wide by 85 kilometers long) and appears
    to lie slightly below the level of the surrounding plains. Some bright icy plates
    which are visible inside appear to be dislodged from the edges of the chaos region.
    The low-lying topography and curved fractures along its boundaries suggest that
    Thera's formation may have involved a collapse.
