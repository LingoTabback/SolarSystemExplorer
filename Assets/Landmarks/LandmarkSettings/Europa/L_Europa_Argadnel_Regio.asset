  m_Title: Argadnel Regio
  m_Caption: "NASA\u2019s Galileo spacecraft captured this image of rugged Argadnel
    Regio in November 1996. The image spans about 150 miles (238 kilometers), roughly
    the distance between Los Angeles and San Diego in Southern California.\u200B"
  m_Description: Symmetric ridges in the dark bands of Argadnel Regio suggest that
    the surface crust was separated and filled with darker material. While some craters
    are visible, the absence of more craters indicates this area is geologically
    young. The youngest ridges in the area have central fractures, aligned knobs
    and irregular dark patches. These and other features might indicate cryovolcanism,
    or processes related to eruption of ice and gases.
