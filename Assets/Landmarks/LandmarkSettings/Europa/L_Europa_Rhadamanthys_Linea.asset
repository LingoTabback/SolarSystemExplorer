  m_Title: Rhadamanthys Linea
  m_Caption: This composite image combines data from the first and 17th Galileo spacecraft
    flybys of Europa to make an enhanced-color view of complex, intriguing terrain.
  m_Description: "As Europa orbits Jupiter it experiences strong tidal forces \u2014
    somewhat like the tides in Earth\u2019s oceans caused by our Moon \u2014 that
    cause its icy outer shell to flex. That flexing leads to intricate patterns of
    linear cracks, ridges, bands, pits and domes that cover much of the moon\u2019s
    surface. This image captures a wide variety of surface features, including the
    prominent ridge Rhadamanthys Linea, which runs through the center of the picture
    from upper left to lower right. While most ridges on Europa have a reddish appearance
    in color images such as this one, Rhadamanthys appears to also have uneven blotches
    of darker, redder material, which are more prominent in some locations than others.
    Some scientists have interpreted the appearance of Rhadamanthys to indicate that
    it is a recently, or perhaps currently, active feature on Europa's surface."
