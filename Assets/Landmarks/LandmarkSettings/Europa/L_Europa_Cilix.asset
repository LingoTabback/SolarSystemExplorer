  m_Title: Cilix
  m_Caption: "This 3D view of Cilix impact crater on Europa was created in 2013 using
    3D stereo images taken by NASA's Galileo spacecraft in the late 1990s.\u200B"
  m_Description: Cilix crater is one of the largest impact craters on Europa. The
    crater rim rises steeply about 980 feet (300 meters) above a flat crater floor
    that is interrupted by a central peak which is about 660 feet (200 meters) high.
    Cilix is approximately 9 miles wide. Well-preserved craters like Cilix are rare
    on Europa's surface, where ongoing geological activity is thought to disrupt
    most surface features over timescales of tens of millions of years.
