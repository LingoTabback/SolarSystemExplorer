  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: One of the most important measurements made by the Galileo mission
    showed how Jupiter's magnetic field was disrupted in the space around Europa.
    The measurement strongly implied that a special type of magnetic field is being
    created (induced) within Europa by a deep layer of some electrically conductive
    fluid beneath the surface. Based on Europa's icy composition, scientists think
    the most likely material to create this magnetic signature is a global ocean
    of salty water, and this magnetic field result is still the best evidence we
    have for the existence of an ocean on Europa.
