  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the
    other is Uranus). Most (80% or more) of the planet's mass is made up of a hot
    dense fluid of \"icy\" materials \u2013 water, methane, and ammonia \u2013 above
    a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.\r\n\r\nScientists
    think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune's cold clouds.
    It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside."
