  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Neptune has at least five main rings and four prominent ring arcs
    that we know of so far. Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main
    rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago, and Adams. The rings are thought
    to be relatively young and short-lived.\r\n\r\nNeptune's ring system also has
    peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Libert\xE9 (Liberty),
    Egalit\xE9 (Equality), Fraternit\xE9 (Fraternity), and Courage are in the outermost
    ring, Adams. The arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that
    they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together. Scientists now
    think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring,
    stabilizes these arcs."
