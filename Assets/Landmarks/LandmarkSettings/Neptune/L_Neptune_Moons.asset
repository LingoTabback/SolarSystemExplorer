  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Neptune has 14 known moons. Neptune''s largest moon Triton was
    discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann
    Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman
    god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in
    Greek mythology.

    

    Triton is the only large moon in the solar system
    that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet''s rotation (a
    retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object
    that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around
    minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this
    deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward
    more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton''s thin atmosphere, also discovered
    by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing
    warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.'
