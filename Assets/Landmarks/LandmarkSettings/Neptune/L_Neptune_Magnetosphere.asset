  m_Title: Magnetosphere
  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "The main axis of Neptune's magnetic field is tipped over by about
    47 degrees compared with the planet's rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic
    axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune's magnetosphere
    undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment.
    The magnetic field of Neptune is about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.\u200B"
