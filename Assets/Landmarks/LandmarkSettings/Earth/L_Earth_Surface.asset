  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains, and valleys.
    Earth''s lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic)
    and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving.
    For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin,
    roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result
    when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make
    mountains, or split and separate.

    

    Earth''s global ocean, which covers
    nearly 70% of the planet''s surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles
    (4 kilometers) and contains 97% of Earth''s water. Almost all of Earth''s volcanoes
    are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii''s Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base
    to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth''s longest
    mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans.
    It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.'
