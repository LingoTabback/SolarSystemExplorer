  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Our planet's rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise
    to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space.
    (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the
    Sun.) When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth's magnetic
    field, they collide with air molecules above our planet's magnetic poles. These
    air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern
    lights.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to
    the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of
    Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field. The geologic
    record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000
    years on average, but the timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a
    magnetic reversal doesn't cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is
    very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does
    happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for
    a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed,
    they will all point south instead of north.\u200B"
