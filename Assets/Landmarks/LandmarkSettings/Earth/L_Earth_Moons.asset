  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: "Earth is the only planet that has a single moon. Our Moon is the
    brightest and most familiar object in the night sky. In many ways, the Moon is
    responsible for making Earth such a great home. It stabilizes our planet's wobble,
    which has made the climate less variable over thousands of years.\r\n\r\nEarth
    sometimes temporarily hosts orbiting asteroids or large rocks. They are typically
    trapped by Earth's gravity for a few months or years before returning to an orbit
    around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a long \u201Cdance\u201D with Earth
    as both orbit the Sun.\r\n\r\nSome moons are bits of rock that were captured
    by a planet's gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions
    of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into
    it, displacing a portion of Earth's interior. The resulting chunks clumped together
    and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon
    is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto,
    and Io).\r\n\r\nThe Moon is an average of 238,855 miles (384,400 kilometers)
    away from Earth. That means 30 Earth-sized planets could fit in between Earth
    and its Moon."
