  m_Title: Chicxulub Crater
  m_Caption: "This shaded relief image of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula, derived from
    data from NASA\u2019 SRTM mission, shows a subtle, but unmistakable, indication
    of the Chicxulub impact crater. Two visualization methods were combined to produce
    the image: shading and color coding of topographic height. Image Credit: NASA/JPL."
  m_Description: The Chicxulub Crater is mostly underwater just off the Yucatan Peninsula.
    It measures some 112 miles (180 kilometers) across and nearly 12 miles (20 kilometers)
    deep. From rim to rim, the diameter of this crater is roughly the distance from
    Austin to Houston, Texas, making it the third largest confirmed impact structure
    on Earth. It is the site of a comet or asteroid impact around 65 million years
    ago believed to have caused global-scale environmental effects that led to the
    extinction of the dinosaurs.
