  m_Description: The lowest spot on land, the Dead Sea depression sinks 1,300 feet
    (400 meters) below sea level. This body of water occurs in a rift zone, where
    the Arabian tectonic plate (east side) is pulling northward, away from the Africa
    tectonic plate (west side). Highlands and plateaus on either side of the rift
    end in escarpments at the seashore.
