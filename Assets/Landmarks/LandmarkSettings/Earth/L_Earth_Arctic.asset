  m_Description: "Most commonly, scientists define the Arctic as the region above
    the Arctic Circle, an imaginary line that circles the globe at approximately
    66\xB0 34' N. The Arctic Circle marks the latitude above which the sun does not
    set on the summer solstice, and does not rise on the winter solstice. The region
    surrounding the North Pole consists of a large ocean surrounded by land. This
    ocean, called the Arctic Ocean, is like no other ocean on Earth; and because
    of its special location and climate, the lands that surround it are unique."
