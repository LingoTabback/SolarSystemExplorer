  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: 'Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core
    at the planet''s center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle, and crust.

    

    The
    inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221
    kilometers) in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit
    (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer
    is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.

    

    In
    between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot,
    viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick
    and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth''s crust, goes
    about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the
    ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the
    seafloor to the top of the mantle.'
