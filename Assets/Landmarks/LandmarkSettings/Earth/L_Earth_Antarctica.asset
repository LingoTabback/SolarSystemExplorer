  m_Description: "Antarctica is Earth\u2019s southernmost continent, located primarily
    south of the Antarctic Circle (66\xB0S). Antarctica is considered a desert because
    it receives very little rain or snowfall, and the small amount of snow it does
    receive builds up over hundreds and thousands of years to form large, thick ice
    sheets. The continent's terrain is made up of glaciers, ice shelves and icebergs.
    The only plants that can survive the extreme cold are lichens, mosses and algae.
    Many types of whales are found in the oceans surrounding Antarctica and the continent
    is home to seals and penguins. While the Antarctic continent ranks only fifth
    in size (larger than Europe and Australia), it is large enough that the entire
    United States could fit within in its 5.4 million square mile (14 million square
    kilometer) size."
