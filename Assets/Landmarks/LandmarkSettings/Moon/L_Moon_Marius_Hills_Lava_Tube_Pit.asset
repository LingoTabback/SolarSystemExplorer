  m_Title: Marius Hills Lava Tube Pit
  m_Caption: "The Marius Hills pit is a possible skylight in a lava tube in an ancient
    volcanic region of the Moon called the Marius Hills. This image comes from NASA\u2019s
    Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. Image credit: NASA/GSFC/Arizona State University"
  m_Description: This pit in the Marius Hills of the Moon intrigues scientists because
    it could be the opening to a large lava tube complex under the lunar surface.
    Such features can help scientists understand volcanic processes and provide clues
    about the types of volcanism the Moon experienced in its early history. Lava
    tubes also may be important to potential future astronauts because they may offer
    protection from harmful radiation, cosmic rays, meteorite impacts and the extreme
    temperature differences between the lunar day and night. A lava tube also could
    be the site of a future lunar base. This circular pit, 190 feet (58 meters) in
    diameter and 131 feet (40 meters) deep, was discovered by Japanese scientists
    in images from the Kaguya orbiter.
