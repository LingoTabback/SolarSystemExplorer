    miles (15 km) wide, left to right (southeast to northwest in this view)."
  m_Description: 'Tycho appears as a bright spot in the southern highlands with rays
    of bright material that stretch across much of the nearside. Its prominence is
    not due to its size: at 85 km in diameter, it''s just one among thousands of
    this size or larger. What makes Tycho stand out is its relative youth.'
