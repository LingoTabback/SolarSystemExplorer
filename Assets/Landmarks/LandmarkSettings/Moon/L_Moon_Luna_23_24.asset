  m_Description: Technical problems prevented Luna 23 from sending back samples from
    the Sea of Crises on the Moon, but Luna 24 dug deeper and returned the largest
    robotic sample of lunar soil to date. The spacecraft drilled down 6.5 feet (2
    meters) into the soil and collected 6 ounces (170 grams) of soil for launch back
    to Soviet scientists on Earth.
