  m_Description: The second rover to make tracks on the Moon was the Soviet Union's
    Lunokhod 2. It landed a month after Apollo 17 and trekked over hills and even
    through craters for a remarkable 24 miles (39 kilometers) - an off-world distance
    driving record that stood until 2014 when the Mars Opportunity rover logged 25
    miles (40 kilometers) on the Red Planet.
