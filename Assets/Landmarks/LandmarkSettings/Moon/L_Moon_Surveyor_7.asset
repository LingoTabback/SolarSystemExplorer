  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: Surveyor 7 was the last of the original series of Surveyor Moon
    landers of the late 1960s and was dedicated primarily to scientific investigations.
    By 1968, the spacecraft's predecessors had already performed much of the investigative
    work into the feasibility of a future human mission to the Moon, so Surveyor
    7's mission was unique.
