  m_Title: Van De Graaf Crater
  m_Caption: 
  m_Description: Unlike other merged craters on the Moon, there is no rim separating
    the two sections of this crater. A relatively strong magnetic field was detected
    near this crater. This discovery is unusual because the Moon does not currently
    have a global magnetic field like the Earth does.
